## Points covered
- [x] Basic React - Making shared components and building a few pages.
- [x] Styling and layout
     - Adding UI library such as Tailwind and font-awesome.

    - Also add individual layouts to your pages to understand the concept of HOCs and layouts better.

- [x] App Routing and navigation - Setting up routes in the application to include the following scenarios:
    - Basic routing, e.g. "/"
    - Nested routing, e.g. ""/restaurants/[restaurant_name]/
    - Dynamic routing, e.g. ""/restaurants/[restaurant_name]/[dish_id]".

- [x] Fetching data from server on multiple pages
    - I am using Prisma ORM and using Supabase as the cloud provider.
- [x] Add loading and error states to your project to provide a better user experience
- [x] Build API routes for your application
- [x] Bonus points for following the Next/Vercel documentation and deploying your application to the cloud
